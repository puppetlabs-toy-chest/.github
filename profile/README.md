## Welcome to the Puppetlabs Toy Chest 👋

At Puppet, open source software is in our DNA. From the earliest days of Facter
to the latest version of Bolt, we’ve always been firm believers in the power of
open source. Part of the open source lifecycle is when a project is ready for a
new maintainer. That is what the Puppetlabs Toy Chest is for.

Projects in this org have reached the end of their maintenance cycle at Puppet,
but may still have a useful lifespan ahead of them under new maintainers. Some,
like [Razor](https://github.com/puppetlabs-toy-chest/razor-server) were shipped
as part of our commercial products. Some were
[prototypes](https://github.com/puppetlabs-toy-chest/puppetcpp)
that never really saw the light of day. Some were
[demos](https://github.com/puppetlabs-toy-chest/puppet-vro-autosign_example)
and some were [examples](https://github.com/puppetlabs-toy-chest/detect_wannacry)
that are now obsolete but still interesting.

But all of the repositories in this org are ready for you to adopt and breathe new
life into. [Learn how to adopt a project now](https://github.com/puppetlabs-toy-chest/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)! 🐾
